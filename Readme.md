# Aperiodic

This is a Haskell implementation of the algorithms proposed in the [four part series](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/quasiblog/aperiodic-tilings/) blog post by Simon Tatham. You can also read my own presentation [here](https://trebor-huang.github.io/forest/tile-0001.xml).

This depends on the [Kleenex](https://github.com/diku-kmc/kleenexlang/) program. I am using a custom local fork for now, so you need to edit the extra dependencies in `stack.yaml` yourself. You may also need to edit the dependency information of that library to make it compile.
